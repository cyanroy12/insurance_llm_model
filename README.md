# 🧠 Insurance LLM Suite: Intelligent Data Extraction & Customer Support Agent (Vertex AI + LangChain)

This project is a **Generative AI-powered insurance solution** built using **Vertex AI**, **LangChain**, and **serverless architecture**. It showcases two practical applications of LLMs in the insurance domain:

- 🗂️ **Module 1: Insurance Data Extractor** – Automatically extracts structured data from insurance claim PDFs using LLM-based document parsing.
- 💬 **Module 2: Customer Support Agent** – A conversational agent that answers customer queries using a fine-tuned LLM, deployed on **Google Cloud Functions**.

---

## 🚀 Project Goals

- ✅ Automate information extraction from complex, semi-structured insurance documents.
- ✅ Deploy an LLM-based support chatbot that provides human-like answers to policy-related questions.
- ✅ Showcase **RAG** (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) and **AutoML fine-tuning** workflows on **Vertex AI**.
- ✅ Deploy both modules in a **serverless, scalable, production-ready** environment.
